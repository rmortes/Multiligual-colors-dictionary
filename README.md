# Multiligual-colors-dictionary
Dictionary containing color references in multiple languages

Currently supporting: English, German, Spanish, French

## Why?
I didn't find any easy way to turn a color in spanish (i.e. "blanco") to a hex color programatically.

> Note: This list is not even close to comprehensive and only supports 4 languages. It's the best I could do with the limited time I had to do it (like 10 minutes). Do feel free to send a PR with improvements in your own language. And by that I mead PLEASE send that PR :)
